# nlib2: General purpose libraries for robotics applications

`nlib2` is a collection of libraries for robotics applications. It is composed of the following components:
* [NlNode](docs/NlNode.md): a convenience class for rapid development of ROS2 nodes
* [Modflow](docs/Modflow.md): a framework for building modular, graph-based software systems with dynamic data flow and type-safe inter-module communication.
